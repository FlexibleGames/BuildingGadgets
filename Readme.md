# Building Gadgets
A mod for Vintage Story

## Name sounds Familiar
Yes, I received permission from Direwolf20 to try to port his MC mod to VS. 

Every mod I've done for Vintage Story has increased my knowledge of the API and allowed
me to tackle the next mod. This mod was a fun challenge to get this far, but there can 
be SO much more added if I ever revisit. Not many people use the mod, but it was a major
learning experience!

## What's it do?
The versatile gadget has 3 main functions **Build - Destroy - Exchange**

5 area-based modes **To me - H Line - V Line - Area - Volume** ("To Me" only works for Build mode)

3 placement modes **On Top - Inside - Under** to control what blocks will be modified based on the block you are looking at.

While it does not use any power as there is not any stable or reliable source of power, I will want to add that feature when the time comes we do have power sources.
